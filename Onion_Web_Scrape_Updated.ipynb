            "Content: WASHINGTON—Having been alive as far back as 1933, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a trailblazer in being old, died Thursday night at age 90. “Sen. Feinstein, born Dianne Goldman, started off young but through hard work and dedication rose through the ranks to become very, very old,” said the late Democrat’s chief of staff, James Sauls, who in prepared remarks to reporters cited Feinstein’s many career highlights, such as turning 88 years old in 2021, turning 89 years old in 2022, and, just this year, turning 90. “Her remarkable persistence as the oldest sitting U.S. senator made her a role model to nonagenarians everywhere. Across the nation tonight, little girls will find inspiration in her story, knowing that they, too, can one day grow up to be incredibly old.” Sauls added that while Feinstein did not fulfill her longtime goal of clinging to power in the Senate as long as her late mentor in aging, the 100-year-old Strom Thurmond, she nonetheless spent her final years shattering expectations for what an unbelievably infirm and exhausted person can and should do. \n",

            "Content: WASHINGTON—Unveiling a commemorative series created in honor of the nation’s most renowned pedophiles, the U.S. Mint announced the release Friday of a new collection of coins that featured a child molester from every state in the union. “This fun, collectible currency showcases each state’s most iconic child sexual predator and begins this month with the release of R. Kelly’s Illinois coin,” said the mint’s director, Ventris C. Gibson, who also unveiled the vinyl display case that enthusiasts could use to show off their collection to friends once they had acquired all 50. “Each month that follows will see the circulation of a new coin, including Jeffrey Epstein of New York, Jerry Sandusky of Pennsylvania, Larry Nassar of Michigan, and former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Massachusetts. Some states had so many notorious child molesters we could hardly settle on just one, so the abusers of underage teens in California, for example, are all represented together by the Hollywood sign.” Gibson added that one of the most interesting parts of the project was the mint’s decision to leave the nickel unchanged, keeping Thomas Jefferson right there where he’s always been.\n",

When I was in the Obama administration, I ate one of his kids.” “That is not a dog. That is a man in a hyper-realistic dog costume.” “My client Commander Biden asks that you respect his privacy at this time.” “But that’s impossible.

I’m going to go lie down and moan in the corner.” “Dogs reflect their owners. Which makes sense based on how many times Joe Biden has bitten his Secret Service agents.” “This is really the human’s fault for being made out of meat.” “You ever seen da Sopranos? So cool.

Then you’ll just be up there by yourself, and let me tell you, things get chilly fast.” Liu also confirmed that all U.S. military tilt-a-whirls would be unaffected by a shutdown as they were classified as essential services.\n",

She’s just in it for the tickets.” “Her favorite movie is The Babadook. She watches it every morning. She thinks she is the Babadook. She used to get up early in the morning and dress up as the Babadook and then leap on my side of the bed and scream, ‘I am the Babadook, and I will sever your arteries,’ which I honestly don’t think is part of the Babadook’s whole thing, but I know better than to question her. The only way to get her to stop was reminding her that the Babadook doesn’t have a soul, and she would get really sad about that and wouldn’t want to be the Babadook anymore. Taylor made my life a living hell.” “She watches too many beheading videos.” “Make sure you’re not related first.” “What’s most important is that you be her friend. Your partner should be your best friend. Someone you go home to and are happy to see at the end of the day. Someone who you trust with everything. Someone who is there for you when nobody else is. That kind of intimacy is the most important thing.” “Travis, please listen to me. I am a heartthrob from the year 2340. You must not, I repeat, not date Ms. Swift, or the world will end. Do you hear me? The fate of the world is in your hands.” “You’ve got the wrong 2010s teen romance. I dated the lesbian.” “Just don’t do that to yourself. I mean, why would you? You’re 10 minutes late to dinner and suddenly—boom—there’s a lyric.” “Wait, you’re dating Taylor Swift? But I’m dating Taylor Swift!” “Be careful about your semen. She collects and freezes semen samples from every guy she dates, and she says one day she’ll impregnate herself with all of them at once and give birth to the Übermensch.” “She’s really not good at the whole long distance thing.” “She will turn you from a boy to a man.” “She already owns a Vitamix and a tote bag, so if you need to get a Christmas gift, I don’t know. House slippers?” “Kevlar body armor will slow her fans’ bullets, but not stop them.” “If she invites you to one of her shows, bring cash.

Well, you know what?

I feel like we should ask him to join our table, but it would be too weird to sit in silence with someone who’s not a person you are stuck eating with every day, all the while secretly hoping they’ll choke on their food, die, and thereby permit you to move on with your life.” At press time, the lone diner was reportedly pitying the bored-looking married couple who, instead of spending the rest of their evening however they pleased, would be forced to come to some sort of bullshit compromise and wind up doing something neither of them really enjoyed.\n",

            "Content: Discussing spirituality with a young person can be difficult, and that might only become more difficult  if they’re questioning the existence of a higher power. Here are some strategies on what to say to a child if they don’t believe in God. Then loudly announce to the rest of the family that only those going to church will get ice cream. On second thought, that’s probably not going to help your case with little Gaius. You can try this line of rhetoric, but they’re definitely not as high as you right now. Got his ass. No kid would choose a party over a stable desk job in the sky. Maybe you can’t convince your child that a divine creator is behind each and every one of us, but President Jackson can. Your child can still be an atheist who hates women. No! Not the column! Not your 11-year-old’s column! Send Richard Dawkins to his room immediately. I mean, did your son even sit down and read the five volumes of the Summa Theologica you got him last Christmas? If the Touched By An Angel star isn’t their speed, there’s also Patricia Heaton. Then insist they get down on the floor and lick your boots clean. Then start packing up your Barrett M82 sniper rifle. That bastard will pay for what he’s done to your child. How else are you going to bridge the gap between quantum and Newtonian mechanics? Support is essential during childhood. It’s good to let your child know that just because they’ve changed their mind, that doesn’t mean it’s time to uproot the entire routine.” Obviously, it’s easy to get disillusioned, but remind them it wasn’t God Himself who molested them, it was only His emissary! Belief in half-mortal, half-deities is a good middle ground for a child who doesn’t want to believe in one all-powerful creator. After raising this baby you found on the steps of your remote monastery one rainy night as a monk, you assumed he’d want to take up the celibate meditative life forever, but God apparently has another path for him. Send that bitch to the hell your kid doesn’t even believe in. As much fun as this would be, make sure they really don’t believe in God before you take this huge, incredibly fun step.

The wind right now is nothing—it’s 5, 10 miles per hour, tops. But from the way the tree is dropping leaves and bending this way and that you’d think we were in a hurricane.

There is no camera and little chance of criminal prosecution. Just place the baby inside the padded bin of our 1,800-degree commercial oven and walk away.” Plemonts went on to discourage parents from leaving a name or contact information with the infant, given that  a piece of paper would just be incinerated along with it.\n",

He  just made it in by the skin of his teeth,” said family friend Julian Martinez, adding that as soon as Butryn saw his hair accumulating in the shower drain, he no doubt realized it was time to buy a ring or be alone for the rest of his life. “Man, he timed it perfectly. Got down on one knee before his thinning hair was obvious in the dim lighting of a romantic restaurant. If he had waited even a moment longer, she definitely would have said no.” Reached for comment, Lewis told reporters she was aware of Butryn’s male pattern baldness at the time of his proposal but said yes anyway, explaining that she was not a superficial person and would never, on the basis of hair loss, turn down a man with such a big cock.\n",

Bob Menendez (D-NJ) has pleaded “not guilty” to sweeping federal charges that accuse him of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts in exchange for political favors. The Onion examined every bribe the Democratic senator has accepted while  in office, and this is what was found. Menendez had already performed several political favors before realizing he easily could’ve gathered them himself. To keep gold bars in. Oh, wait, these are actually the legal kinds of bribes.  Yearly payouts allegedly accepted as part of a quid pro quo with U.S. corporations and military contractors. Shower time sure is a lot more fun with this mega-plush robe. If you feel like these aren’t worth much, wait five years. Only got to use it once, but it was worth it. Normally the best insider tips are reserved for Pelosi, but Menendez was allowed to press his ear against her door for a full five minutes. It’s unclear where the bulk of this ancient Egyptian monument went, but chunks of it filled up two guest rooms in Menendez’s home and most of his garage. With this boost, Menendez has allegedly reached the Diamond League and is looking forward to hitting his 200-day streak. The cursed beast was given in exchange for an aluminum-siding contract in Trenton. For outstanding work in an ultra-competitive field. Only a TV show, though—it’s not like he’s the president. For this prop used in the original Clerks, Menendez reportedly interfered in more than two dozen federal prosecutions. Perfect for cruising the streets or just hanging in the Target parking lot with buddies. The privilege to drunkenly call Robert Saleh at 3:45 a.m. and slur out one’s thoughts on how to turn the franchise around was formerly reserved for Menendez only.

The Onion asked Swift’s ex-boyfriends to give Kelce advice on how to make this relationship a success. “Her fans are fucking crazy and awful and she hates their guts, so don’t say you support her fans.” “Trust me, buddy. She’s just in it for the tickets.” “Her favorite movie is The Babadook. She watches it every morning. She thinks she is the Babadook.

The only way to get her to stop was reminding her that the Babadook doesn’t have a soul, and she would get really sad about that and wouldn’t want to be the Babadook anymore. Taylor made my life a living hell.” “She watches too many beheading videos.” “Make sure you’re not related first.” “What’s most important is that you be her friend. Your partner should be your best friend. Someone you go home to and are happy to see at the end of the day. Someone who you trust with everything. Someone who is there for you when nobody else is. That kind of intimacy is the most important thing.” “Travis, please listen to me. I am a heartthrob from the year 2340. You must not, I repeat, not date Ms. Swift, or the world will end. Do you hear me? The fate of the world is in your hands.” “You’ve got the wrong 2010s teen romance. I dated the lesbian.” “Just don’t do that to yourself. I mean, why would you?

            "Content: NEW YORK—As the league sought to crack down on players involved in gambling, the NFL  announced this week the suspension of four players for violating the DraftKings terms of use. “The players in question are receiving indefinite suspensions for conduct that goes against the basic integrity of DraftKings and everything that DraftKings stands for,” said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, adding that the players in question failed to abide by several key stipulations clearly laid out in the sports betting company’s legal agreement. “The league takes this matter very seriously, and we cannot permit our players to put our fans’ belief in the outcome of their DraftKings bets in jeopardy through their casual flaunting of the rules. DraftKings made these rules for a reason, whether that’s eligibility or withdrawal of prizes, and we need to punish those who violate the rules to deter future violations. These players need to remember who they work for.” Goodell also reminded the rest of the league to take the four players’ suspensions into account when placing their future DraftKings bets.\n",

            "Content: DALLAS—In response to questions concerning where he would play in the 2023-2024 season, free agent guard Kyrie Irving told reporters Monday that he was excited to alienate all potential options. “There are several teams that are definitely at the top of my list in terms of who I’d be most interested in taking meetings with to completely piss off,” said Irving, adding that there were many teams whose chemistry he could destroy by signing with them and giving them absolutely no chance of making it to the NBA Finals. “I’m definitely considering re-alienating the Mavericks, but I also think I could really irritate the coaching staffs on teams like the Suns and the Heat. I could also always go to a rebuilding team to help ruin the development of their younger guys. Of course, it’s always tempting to just sign with the Lakers and spend every day making LeBron James’ life a living hell.” The 31-year-old added that he wanted to take his time with his decision, as he hoped to stay with his future team until mid-December when they finally get sick of his bullshit and waive him.\n",

            "Content: MIAMI—Following reports that he was under investigation by Miami-Dade Police for his role in a violent altercation at the Haulover Marina, Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill told reporters Friday that he was surprised to discover that assault is illegal in Florida. “When I knew Kansas City was going to trade me last year, there’s a reason I wanted to go a team in Florida—I was pretty sure you could kind of just do whatever here,” said Hill, adding that he even asked some of his teammates on the Dolphins whether it was okay to do something like hit a man in the back of the head without facing any kind of punishment, and they agreed that it was probably fine in Florida, and definitely in Miami. “I thought Florida was, like, the place where you went when you wanted to cause unwarranted physical harm to another person without getting in trouble. Maybe someone could double-check, because it doesn’t sound right that you can get arrested for assault here. Or maybe I’m mixing it up with sexual assault. Shit. That’s definitely got to be legal in Florida, right? Otherwise, what is even the point of this state? If you want to live somewhere where you’re apparently not allowed to commit assault, you can always go to Kansas City. Shit, maybe this is one of those states where you have to be married to the person if you want to legally smack them around.” Hill told reporters that even if he is arrested and convicted of assault, he wasn’t worried about being suspended, saying that there is absolutely no way that the NFL has jurisdiction over players who play in Florida.\n",
